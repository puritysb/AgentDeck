/**
 * timeline-task-display.ts — the SINGLE source of truth for how task
 * hierarchy rows (`task_start` / `task_end`) are RENDERED.
 *
 * Contract (2026-07-19, "one row per task"):
 *   - `task_end` is a DATA-ONLY closure record. It stays on the wire and in
 *     every store — it stops the in-flight spinner (`isInFlightTask`), is the
 *     judge-result upsert vehicle (merge by type='task_end' + taskId), and is
 *     what the orphan reaper synthesizes — but renderers NEVER show it as a
 *     standalone row. Before this contract the visible timeline was dominated
 *     by reaper-synthesized "Interrupted · ~Xh" rows (no judge ever runs for
 *     those), while the judged closures were suppressed as internal
 *     boundaries: the noise showed and the signal hid.
 *   - A task renders as at most ONE row: its `task_start` header, which FOLDS
 *     IN the matching closure's fields — closure label (`task_end.raw`, e.g.
 *     "Session end · 2 turns · 6m 5s"), the judge's one-line summary as the
 *     title WHENEVER it exists (the outcome outranks the intent in the single
 *     line a row gets; the intent-derived header title — `deriveTaskTitle` —
 *     fills the slot until the judge answers, and forever for unjudged
 *     tasks), and the score/outcome badge.
 *   - Header visibility: meaningful title OR eval payload (own or closure).
 *     `_empty` category always hides. Bare unjudged tasks — including every
 *     interrupted reaper closure — render nothing; the timeline stays an
 *     activity log of actual turns.
 *
 * Mirrors (update in the same commit):
 *   - Apple  `timelineShouldShowTaskMarker` / `timelineTaskClosure` /
 *     `timelineTaskHeaderDisplay` (apple/.../UI/Monitor/TimelineStripView.swift)
 *   - Android `shouldShowTaskMarker` / `taskClosure` / `taskHeaderDisplay`
 *     (android/.../state/TimelineDisplay.kt)
 *   - ESP32 boards exclude task rows from milestone/ticker selection
 *     (esp32/src/ui/eink/eink_display.cpp, esp32/src/ui/widgets/hud_bar.cpp)
 *     — no closure fold there; glance surfaces show turn rows only.
